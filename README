USAGE:
make
kron_generator EDGECOUNT NUM_2SEEDS NUM_3SEEDS NUM_5SEEDS > OUTPUT_GRAPH.net
	# OUTPUT_GRAPH.net is in edgelist format, per-line source target
optional: net2undir OUTPUT_GRAPH.net [UNDIR_GRAPH.net]
	# makes the graph undirected if you want to experiment with that
net2deg GRAPH.net [GRAPH.deg]
	# in GRAPH.deg, lineno is vertex ID and value is count
deg2freqdeg GRAPH.deg [GRAPH.freqdeg]
	# in GRAPH.freqdeg, val1 is count and val2 is degree
	# if you want a freq v. deg plot that means plot val1 on y and val2 on x, e.g.
gnuplot
	set logscale x
	set logscale y
	plot 'GRAPH.freqdeg' u 2:1
	# i also like:
	set style fill solid
	plot 'GRAPH.freqdeg' u 2:1 w boxes
